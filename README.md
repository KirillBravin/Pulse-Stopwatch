## Architectural Principles

* **BEM** (Block, Element, Modifier) is a component-based approach to web development. The idea behind it is to divide the user interface into independent blocks. This makes interface development easy and fast even with a complex UI, and it allows reuse of existing code without copying and pasting.

## Copyright content

I do not own any of the content. This is project was solely made to practice HTML/CSS/SCSS skills. Any similarities to the real watches is pure coincidence.
